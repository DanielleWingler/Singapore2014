I have been in Singapore for a week and two days now. The Welcome Fest by [NUS i.CARE][iCARE] has been incredibly helpful in meeting other international students studying here.

The [Malay class and Singlish class][Language] offered during Welcome Fest was entertaining and helped introduce me to the local culture while making excursions off of campus less intimidating. The [Heartland tour][Heart] was another activity that went a long way in making me comfortable exploring local communities. 

The exploration of food here is a past time that can easily be used as conversation starters that can end up being the entire conversation. Many people enjoy talking about the varieties of food that can be found here in Singapore. 

The people here have all been incredibly friendly and it has been a clean and safe place that has made my first time overseas enjoyable. 

The variety of exchange and international students here have introduced me to many other cultures as well. The National University of Singapore provides a global experience that goes beyond just Singapore.
